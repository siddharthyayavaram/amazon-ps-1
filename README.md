 – Defined a predictive metric to provide an indication of the health of shipping cost of an item.
 – The best performing regression models were: LGBMRegressor, HistGradientBoostingRegressor, RandomForestRegressor

Amazon ships billions of packages in a year, incurring multi-billions of
dollars in shipping cost. The shipping cost is optimized for most of the
shipments, however certain shipments have a cost higher than expected. In
this project, we would create a predictive (ML based) model to understand
if a shipment cost is higher for an item. The Project aims to define a metric
to provides an indication of the health of shipping cost of an item. This
metric would be used by business teams to deep dive on the item attributes
to understand why shipping cost is high/low. The metric will have a
principled backing and have its pros-cons analysis with other proposed
metrics. The methodology will take in account of corner cases like items
with low shipping count, heavy-bulky items having high shipping cost etc.

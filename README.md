Amazon ships billions of packages in a year, incurring multi-billions of dollars in shipping cost. The shipping cost is optimized for most of the shipments, however, certain shipments have a cost higher than expected. In this project, we would create a predictive (ML based) model to understand if a shipment cost is higher for an item. The Project aims to define a metric to provide an indication of the health of shipping cost of an item. This metric would be used by business teams to deep dive into the item attributes to understand why shipping cost is high/low. The metric will have a principled backing and have its pros-cons analysis with other proposed metrics. The methodology will take into account corner cases like items with low shipping count, heavy-bulky items having high shipping cost, etc.

**Key Objectives:**

1. Define a predictive metric for assessing the health of shipping cost.
2. Develop a machine learning-based model to identify why certain shipments have higher shipping costs than expected.

**Best Performing Regression Models:**
- LGBMRegressor
- HistGradientBoostingRegressor
- RandomForestRegressor

I also worked on tasks involving Named Entity Recognition , please find the link attached here https://github.com/arnavyayavaram/Amazon_PS1/

### Named Entity Recognition using BERT

- Utilized BERT for Named Entity Recognition (NER) on unstructured text to identify the Brand and Model of products.

### Knowledge Base (KB) Development

- Developed a knowledge base (KB) of product brands and models by extracting details from product, manufacturer, and review webpages.

### Tools and Technologies

- *Languages*: Python
- *Libraries*: Pandas, Spacy
- *Machine Learning*: BERT, LGBMRegressor, HistGradientBoostingRegressor, RandomForestRegressor
- *Web Framework*: Django REST Framework
